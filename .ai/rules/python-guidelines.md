# Python Guidelines

Rules and conventions for Python code in this repository.

## Critical Rules

These are the conventions that matter most for code quality and maintainability.
Exceptions exist, but they should be rare and justified in a code comment.

### Keep imports at the top of the file

**Always flag** any `import` statement that appears inside a function body, method,
or class. Imports inside functions hide dependencies, make the module harder to
understand at a glance, and can mask missing packages until a specific code path
is hit at runtime.

**Always flag** `try/except ImportError` around imports (except for the documented
exceptions below). This pattern creates two execution modes -- one with the library
and one without -- which doubles the testing surface and produces confusing
behavior when the dependency is unexpectedly absent.

```python
# BAD -- import inside function; dependency is invisible until this path runs
# ALWAYS FLAG THIS PATTERN
def process_data():
    import json
    return json.loads(data)

# BAD -- try/except hides a missing dependency behind a flag
try:
    import requests
    HAS_REQUESTS = True
except ImportError:
    HAS_REQUESTS = False

# GOOD -- direct import at module top; fails immediately if missing
import json
import requests
```

Failing immediately on a missing dependency is better than hiding the problem
until a user hits an obscure code path in production. If a package is required,
add it to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` so it's installed upfront.

**Exception: optional dependencies and pytest collection.** This repo has multiple
optional backends (vLLM, SGLang, TRT-LLM, cupy, etc.) that are not installed in
every environment. Using `try/except ImportError` is the correct pattern when:

- An optional backend dependency (e.g. `tritonclient.grpc`, `vllm_omni`,
  `torch_memory_saver`) may not be installed, and the code provides a
  fallback or sets the import to `None`.
- A test file needs to skip collection when optional packages are absent
  (e.g. `except ImportError: pytest.skip(..., allow_module_level=True)`).
- A stdlib module has version-dependent availability
  (e.g. `tomllib` on Python 3.11+ vs `tomli` fallback).

```python
# OK -- optional backend, graceful fallback to None
try:
    from vllm_omni.diffusion.data import DiffusionParallelConfig
except ImportError:
    DiffusionParallelConfig = None

# OK -- skip test collection when optional deps are missing
try:
    from dynamo.profiler.rapid import WorkloadSpec
except ImportError as e:
    pytest.skip(f"Skip (missing dependency): {e}", allow_module_level=True)

# OK -- stdlib version compatibility
try:
    import tomllib
except ImportError:
    import tomli as tomllib
```

### Prefer failing fast over hiding errors

From PEP 20 (The Zen of Python):

> *"Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced."*
> *"Explicit is better than implicit."*

Failing immediately when something goes wrong is better than silently continuing
with bad state, because:

- The person who caused the error sees it right away, while the context is fresh.
- The stack trace points directly at the root cause, not at a downstream symptom
  three function calls later.
- Hidden errors compound -- a swallowed exception in one place produces confusing
  behavior somewhere else, and the debugging cost grows exponentially with distance
  from the original failure.

```python
# BAD -- all of these hide errors
except Exception:
    pass

except Exception as e:
    logging.error(e)        # logs but silently continues!
    return []               # returns a fake default

# BAD -- bare except catches KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit too,
# making the process impossible to kill with Ctrl-C or sys.exit()
try:
    do_work()
except:
    log_error()

# GOOD -- just let it crash
result = something()

# GOOD -- catch SPECIFIC exceptions you can actually handle
try:
    result = json.loads(text)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    result = {}

# GOOD -- if you must catch broad, catch Exception (not bare except)
# and re-raise after logging
try:
    result = something()
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed: {e}")
    raise
```

**Three rules:**
1. Remove the try/except if possible -- let it crash.
2. Catch **specific** exceptions only (`FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`, etc.).
3. If you must catch broadly, use `except Exception:` (never bare `except:`) and **always** re-raise after logging.

### NO defensive `getattr()` on known types

**Always flag** `getattr(obj, "attr", default)` when the object's type is known
and the attribute is part of its definition (class attribute, `__init__` parameter,
dataclass field, etc.). Using `getattr()` with a default hides bugs by silently
returning a fallback when the attribute should always exist. Direct attribute
access fails loudly if the type contract changes, which is what you want.

```python
# BAD -- cfg is a ServiceConfig with host/port; getattr hides AttributeError
# ALWAYS FLAG THIS PATTERN
cfg = ServiceConfig(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
host = getattr(cfg, "host", "localhost")
port = getattr(cfg, "port", 9999)

# GOOD -- direct access, fails loudly if something is wrong
host = cfg.host
port = cfg.port
```

## Anti-Patterns That Must Be Flagged in Review

Every item below is a **mandatory review check**. If any of these patterns appear
in a pull request, flag it and request changes. These are not style preferences --
they are sources of real bugs, resource leaks, and CI flakiness.

### Mutable default arguments

**Always flag** any function whose default argument is a mutable object (`[]`, `{}`,
`set()`). Default values are evaluated once at function definition time and shared
across all calls, so mutations accumulate silently between invocations.

```python
# BAD -- the list is shared across all calls; flag this
def add_item(item, items=[]):
    items.append(item)
    return items

add_item("a")  # ["a"]
add_item("b")  # ["a", "b"] -- not ["b"]!

# GOOD -- use None sentinel, create a new list each call
def add_item(item, items=None):
    if items is None:
        items = []
    items.append(item)
    return items
```

### Leaked file handles -- always use context managers

**Always flag** any `open()` call that is not wrapped in a `with` statement.
Files, network connections, subprocesses, and locks must be opened with `with`
so they are released even if an exception occurs. Bare `open()` followed by
manual `.close()` leaks the handle when an exception fires between the two calls.

```python
# BAD -- file handle leaks if json.load raises; flag this
f = open("data.json")
data = json.load(f)
f.close()

# GOOD
with open("data.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)
```

This is especially important in this project where tests manage subprocesses,
etcd/NATS connections, and temp directories. Use `ManagedProcess`,
`tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`, and similar context managers rather than
manual setup/teardown.

### Shadowing built-in names

**Always flag** any variable named `list`, `dict`, `id`, `type`, `input`, `open`,
`format`, `set`, `map`, `filter`, `range`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `bytes`,
`tuple`, `hash`, `len`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `any`, `all`, `zip`, `enumerate`,
`sorted`, `reversed`, or `next`. Assigning to these names overwrites the built-in
and causes confusing `TypeError`s later in the same scope.

```python
# BAD -- shadows built-in list(); flag this
list = get_items()
filtered = list(some_gen)   # TypeError: 'list' object is not callable

# GOOD
items = get_items()
filtered = list(some_gen)
```

### Use `is` for None / True / False comparisons

**Always flag** `== None`, `== True`, `== False`, `!= None`, `!= True`, and
`!= False`. These invoke `__eq__`, which can be overridden and produce
surprising results. Use `is` / `is not` for singleton comparisons.

```python
# BAD -- flag these
if result == None:
if flag == True:
if done == False:

# GOOD
if result is None:
if flag is True:     # or just: if flag:
if not done:
```

### Do not modify a collection while iterating

**Always flag** any loop that adds, removes, or deletes from the collection it is
iterating over. This causes skipped elements, `RuntimeError` (for dicts), or
infinite loops. Build a new collection or iterate over a copy.

```python
# BAD -- RuntimeError on dict, skips elements on list; flag this
for item in items:
    if item.is_stale():
        items.remove(item)

# GOOD
items = [item for item in items if not item.is_stale()]
```

### Prefer `join()` over string concatenation in loops

**Always flag** `+=` on a string variable inside a loop. Repeated `+=` on strings
creates a new string object each time, which is O(n^2) for large loops.

```python
# BAD -- O(n^2) string building; flag this
result = ""
for line in lines:
    result += line + "\n"

# GOOD -- O(n) with join
result = "\n".join(lines)
```

### Late-binding closures in loops

**Always flag** lambdas or inner functions created inside a loop that reference the
loop variable without binding it as a default argument. Closures capture the
variable reference, not its value at the time of creation, so all closures end up
with the final loop value.

```python
# BAD -- all lambdas return 4 (the final value of i); flag this
fns = [lambda: i for i in range(5)]
[f() for f in fns]  # [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

# GOOD -- default argument captures current value
fns = [lambda i=i: i for i in range(5)]
[f() for f in fns]  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Do not use `assert` for runtime validation

**Always flag** `assert` statements used to validate function arguments, request
payloads, configuration, or any data that comes from outside the current function.
Assertions are stripped when Python runs with `-O` (optimize), silently removing
the validation. Use explicit `if/raise` for checks that must always execute.

```python
# BAD -- silently skipped under python -O; flag this
assert user_id is not None, "user_id required"

# GOOD
if user_id is None:
    raise ValueError("user_id required")
```

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8.
- `snake_case` for variables and functions.
- `PascalCase` for classes.
- Add type hints where they improve readability.
- Use docstrings for public functions and classes.
- Use `dataclass` instead of plain dicts when a structure has >4 fields (better
  type inference and IDE support).

## File Organization

- `__init__.py` for package initialization.
- Clear module separation.
- Tests in `tests/` directory.

## Formatting and Linting

### Preferred workflow

Auto-fix formatting, then lint:

```bash
ruff format <touched_paths>
ruff check --fix <touched_paths>
```

Or use pre-commit (runs isort, black, flake8, ruff, and more):

```bash
pre-commit run --files <touched_files>
pre-commit run --all-files    # for broad changes
```

### Pre-commit hooks

The repo's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs these Python hooks:

- **isort** -- import sorting (`profile = "black"`, configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- **black** -- code formatting
- **flake8** -- style checks (`max-line-length=88`)
- **ruff** -- fast linting with auto-fix
- **codespell** -- spelling checks
- **trailing-whitespace**, **end-of-file-fixer**, **check-yaml**, **check-json**, **check-toml**

### Before committing

Always run:

```bash
pre-commit run --files <changed_files>
```

For broader changes or if in doubt:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Indentation verification

Indentation errors are common and hard to spot visually. After editing Python
files, verify mechanically:

```bash
ruff format <touched_paths>                     # auto-fix (preferred)
python3 -m compileall -q <touched_paths>        # fast parse-only check
```

When fixing indentation errors, always read 20-30 lines of surrounding context
and fix the whole block -- adjacent lines often share the same mistake.

## Error Handling

See the **Critical Rules** section above for the full policy. Summary:

- Let exceptions propagate by default.
- Catch only specific exceptions you can actually handle.
- If you catch `Exception`, you must re-raise after logging.
- No `except Exception: pass`. Ever.

### Regex caution

Be careful with escaping in raw strings (`\s` vs `\\s`). When changing a critical
regex, add a one-line test to prove it matches.

## Import Order

Imports are sorted by isort with `profile = "black"` (configured in `pyproject.toml`).
The order is:

1. Standard library
2. Third-party (known: `vllm`, `tensorrt_llm`, `sglang`, `aiconfigurator`)
3. First-party (`dynamo`, `deploy`)

Run `isort` or `pre-commit run isort` to auto-fix ordering
